## Ensemble Techniques

There are 2 types of ensemble techniques:
**1. Bagging:** Also know as Booststrap Aggregation. (Voted method or majority based) 
- Ramdomly selected data points from the datset.
- Many estimators are used.
- than we take avg of all the estimators.
**2. Booting:** Only one estimetor is use in this technique. we keep itreting the this process to low the error.


##### Boosting
- Ada Boosting
- Gradient Boosting
